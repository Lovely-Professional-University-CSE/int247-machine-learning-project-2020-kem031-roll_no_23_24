# int247-machine-learning-project-2020-kem031-roll_no_23_24

Name:- Image segmentation with CamVid

FrameWork Used:- Fastai which sits on top of Pytorch

DataSet - CamVid Dataset

Real World Use:- Basic CNN model essential for Autonomous Driving

Made By- Priyansh Soniya - 11711808
         Rishi Raj Singh - 11711818

Accuracy Achieved:- 93.5%

Method To Try The Model:
1. Clone The repo
2. Run Without train model.ipynb
3. Use any image of streets you like for predictions
4. Leave rest of the code untouched.
5. Can see the actual code in actual model.ipynb


System Setup required to run the project:

Open terminal on linux:
1. conda update conda
2. conda install -c pytorch -c fastai fastai pytorch

If having problem:
